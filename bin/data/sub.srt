1
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,744
The first image he told me about was of
three children on a road in Iceland, in 1965.

2
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:35,603
He said that for him
it was the image of happiness...

3
00:00:36,124 --> 00:00:39,210
and also that he had tried several times
to link it to other images...

4
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:40,575
but it never worked.

5
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:41,456
He wrote me...

6
00:00:42,426 --> 00:00:44,825
one day I'll have to put it all alone
at the beginning of a film...

7
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:46,649
with a long piece of black leader.

8
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:52,270
If they don't see happiness in the picture,
at least they'll see the black.

9
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,622
He wrote: "I'm just back from Hokkaido,
the Northern Island.

10
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:30,400
Rich and hurried Japanese take the plane,
others take the ferry:

11
00:01:31,538 --> 00:01:33,873
waiting, immobility,
snatches of sleep.

12
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:38,560
Curiously all of that makes me think
of a past or future war:

13
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:41,150
night trains, air raids,
fallout shelters.

14
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:44,938
Small fragments of war
enshrined in everyday life.

15
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:01,623
He liked the fragility of those moments
suspended in time.

16
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:06,191
Those memories whose only function it being
to leave behind nothing but memories.

17
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,832
He wrote...

18
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:13,125
"I've been round the world several times
and now only banality still interests me".

19
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:17,940
On this trip I've tracked it
with the relentlessness of a bounty hunter.

20
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,828
At dawn we'll be in Tokyo.

21
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:46,203
He used to write me from Africa.

22
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:51,641
He contrasted African time to European time,
and also to Asian time.

23
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,852
He said that in the 19th century
mankind had come to terms with space,

24
00:02:56,185 --> 00:03:01,242
and that the great question of the 20th was
the coexistence of different concepts of time.

25
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:05,689
By the way, did you know that there are emus
in the Île de France?

26
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,549
He wrote me that in the Bijagós Islands
it's the young girls who choose their fiancées.

27
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:23,946
He wrote me that in the suburbs of Tokyo
there is a temple consecrated to cats.

28
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,997
I wish I could convey to you the simplicity,
the lack of affectation...

29
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:50,947
of this couple who had come to place
an inscribed wooden slat in the cat cemetery,

30
00:03:51,646 --> 00:03:54,150
so their cat Tora would be protected.

31
00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:57,686
No she wasn't dead, only run away.

32
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:01,681
But on the day of her death no one
would know how to pray for her,

33
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,607
how to intercede with death so that
he would call her by her right name.

34
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:09,619
So they had to come there,
both of them, under the rain,

35
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:13,635
to perform the rite that would repair
the web of time where it had been broken.

36
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:27,574
He wrote me...

37
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:31,510
"I will have spent my life trying to
understand the function of remembering,

38
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:35,388
"which is not the opposite of forgetting,
but rather its lining.

39
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:41,148
"We do not remember, we rewrite memory
much as history is rewritten.

40
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,130
How can one remember thirst?

41
00:04:56,318 --> 00:04:57,800
He didn't like to dwell on poverty,

42
00:04:58,294 --> 00:05:03,254
but in everything he wanted to show
there were also the 4-Fs of the Japanese model.

43
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,496
A world full of bums, of lumpens,
of outcasts, of Koreans.

44
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:13,240
Too broke to afford drugs,
they'd get drunk on beer, on fermented milk.

45
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,215
This morning in Namidabashi, twenty minutes
from the glories of the center city,

46
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:22,709
a character took his revenge on society
by directing traffic at the crossroads.

47
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,528
Luxury for them would be
one of those large bottles of sake...

48
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:29,910
that are poured over tombs
on the day of the dead.

49
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:58,973
I paid for a round in a bar
in Namidabashi.

50
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:03,484
It's the kind of place that allows people
to stare at each other with equality.

51
00:06:04,355 --> 00:06:08,987
The threshold below which every man is
as good as any other.. and knows it.

52
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:22,986
He told me about the Jetty on Fogo,
in the Cape Verde islands.

53
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:25,986
How long have they been there
waiting for the boat...

54
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,269
patient as pebbles,
but ready to jump?

55
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:34,298
They are a people of wanderers,
of navigators, of world travelers.

56
00:06:34,984 --> 00:06:37,484
They fashioned themselves through
cross-breeding here on these rocks...

57
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:40,976
that the Portuguese used
as a marshaling yard for their colonies.

58
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:47,287
A people of nothing, a people of emptiness,
a vertical people.

59
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:51,916
Frankly, have you ever heard
of anything stupider...

60
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,510
than to say to people as they teach
in film schools, not to look at the camera?

61
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,934
He used to write to me: the Sahel is not only
what is shown of it when it is too late.

62
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:15,280
It's a land that drought seeps
into like water into a leaking boat.

63
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:20,738
The animals resurrected for the time of
a carnival in Bissau will be petrified again,

64
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:24,291
as soon as a new attack
has changed the savannah into a desert.

65
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:28,172
This is a state of survival that
the rich countries have forgotten.

66
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,890
With one exception...
UN Japan.

67
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,515
My constant comings and goings
are not a search for contrasts.

68
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:39,486
They are a journey
to the two extreme poles of survival.

69
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:02,387
He spoke to me of Sei Shonagon,

70
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,620
a lady in waiting to Princess Sadako
at the beginning of the 11th century...

71
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:07,572
in the Heian period.

72
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,780
Do we ever know where history is really made?

73
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,244
Rulers ruled and used complicated strategies
to fight one another.

74
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:19,778
Real power was in the hands
of a family of hereditary regents.

75
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,290
The emperor's court had become
nothing more...

76
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,617
than a place of intrigues
and intellectual games.

77
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,900
By learning to draw a sort
of melancholy comfort...

78
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:29,631
from the contemplation
of the tiniest things...

79
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:33,301
this small group of idlers left a mark
on Japanese sensibility...

80
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:36,874
much deeper than the mediocre thundering
of the politicians.

81
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:40,304
Shonagon had a passion for lists...

82
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:45,168
the list of 'elegant things'...
'distressing things...

83
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:48,766
or even of 'things not worth doing'.

84
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:52,140
One day she got the idea of drawing up a list
of...

85
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:54,352
'things that quicken the heart'.

86
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:58,179
Not a bad criterion I realize
when I'm filming.

87
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,701
I bow to the economic miracle...

88
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:04,257
but what I want to show you
are the neighborhood celebrations.

89
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:33,324
He wrote me...

90
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,230
"Coming back through the Chiba coast
I thought of Shonagon's list,

91
00:13:37,703 --> 00:13:42,956
of all those signs one has only to name
to quicken the heart, just name.

92
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:47,450
To us, a sun is not quite a sun
unless it's radiant...

93
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:50,288
and a spring not quite a spring
unless it is limpid.

94
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,545
Here to place adjectives would be so rude
as leaving price tags on purchases.

95
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:57,424
Japanese poetry never modifies.

96
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,284
There is a way of saying...

97
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:04,718
boat, rock, mist, frog, crow, hail, heron,
chrysanthemum...

98
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,672
that includes them all.

99
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,754
Newspapers have been filled recently
with the story of a man from Nagoya.

100
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:14,721
The woman he loved died last year
and he drowned himself in work...

101
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:16,692
Japanese style, like a madman.

102
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,467
It seems he even made
an important discovery in electronics.

103
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,585
And then in the month of May he killed himself.

104
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:26,310
They say he could not stand
hearing the word 'spring'.

105
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:02,713
He described me his reunion with Tokyo:

106
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:05,431
like a cat who has come home
from vacation in his basket...

107
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,280
immediately starts
to inspect familiar places.

108
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:11,250
He ran off to see if everything
was where it should be:

109
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:13,894
the Ginza owl, the Shimbashi locomotive...

110
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:17,576
the temple of the fox at the top
of the Mitsukoshi department store...

111
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,620
which he found invaded
by little girls and rock singers.

112
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,704
He was told that it was now little girls
who made and unmade stars...

113
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:26,154
the producers shuddered before them.

114
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,196
He was told that a disfigured woman
took off her mask in front of passers-by...

115
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:32,565
and scratched them
if they did not find her beautiful.

116
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,515
Everything interested him.

117
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:37,877
He who didn't give a damn,
if the Dodgers won the pennant...

118
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:39,827
or about the results
of the Daily Double...

119
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:43,755
asked feverishly how Chiyonofuji had done
in the last sumo tournament.

120
00:15:44,472 --> 00:15:47,665
He asked for news of the imperial family,
of the crown prince,...

121
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,680
of the oldest mobster in Tokyo...

122
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,247
who appears regularly on television
to teach goodness to children.

123
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,899
These simple joys he had never felt...

124
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,365
of returning to a country,
a house, a family home.

125
00:15:59,996 --> 00:16:03,402
But twelve million anonymous inhabitants
could supply him with them.

126
00:17:07,495 --> 00:17:08,254
He wrote...

127
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:12,509
"Tokyo is a city crisscrossed by trains,
tied together with electric wire...

128
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,284
she shows her veins.

129
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:17,804
They say that television
makes her people illiterate.

130
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,352
As for me, I've never seen
so many people reading in the streets.

131
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:23,843
Perhaps they read only in the street...

132
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,694
or perhaps they just pretend to read,
these yellow men.

133
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,238
I make my appointments at Kinokuniya,
the big bookshop in Shinjuku.

134
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:34,967
The graphic genius that allowed
the Japanese to invent CinemaScope...

135
00:17:35,162 --> 00:17:36,609
ten centuries before the movies...

136
00:17:36,962 --> 00:17:40,580
compensates a little for the sad fate
of the comic strip heroines,

137
00:17:40,677 --> 00:17:45,287
victims of heartless story writers
and of castrating censorship.

138
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,922
Sometimes they escape,
and you find them again on the walls.

139
00:17:50,691 --> 00:17:52,732
The entire city is a comic strip.

140
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,593
It's Planet Manga.

141
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,485
How can one fail
to recognize the statuary...

142
00:17:57,641 --> 00:18:00,367
that goes from plasticized baroque
to Stalin central?

143
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,130
And the giant faces with eyes that weigh down
on the comic book readers,

144
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:08,318
pictures bigger than people,
voyeurizing the voyeurs.

145
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:21,368
At nightfall the megalopolis
breaks down into villages,

146
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,332
with its country cemeteries
in the shadow of banks...

147
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:26,515
with its stations and temples.

148
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:30,577
Each district of Tokyo once again becomes
a tidy ingenuous little town...

149
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:32,651
nestling amongst the skyscrapers.

150
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:46,290
The small bar in Shinjuku reminded him
of that Indian flute...

151
00:18:46,222 --> 00:18:48,917
whose sound can only be heard
by whomever is playing it.

152
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:54,300
He might have cried out if it was
in a Godard film or a Shakespeare play...

153
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,846
"Where should this music be?"

154
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:03,455
Later he told me he had eaten
at the restaurant in Nishi-nippori...

155
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:07,507
where Mr. Yamada practices
the difficult art of 'action cooking'.

156
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,872
He said that by watching carefully
Mr. Yamada's gestures...

157
00:19:14,137 --> 00:19:15,833
and his way of mixing
the ingredients...

158
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,142
one could meditate usefully
on certain fundamental concepts...

159
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:22,172
common to painting,
philosophy, and karate.

160
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,899
He claimed that Mr. Yamada possessed
in his humble way the essence of style,

161
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:29,147
and consequently that was up to him...

162
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:33,633
to use his invisible brush to write upon
this first day in Tokyo the words...

163
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:37,615
'the end'.

164
00:19:41,826 --> 00:19:45,161
I've spent the day in front of my TV set,
that memory box.

165
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:48,346
I was in Nara with the sacred deers.

166
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:53,475
I was taking a picture without knowing
that in the 15th century Basho had written:

167
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:57,849
"The willow sees the heron's image...
upside down".

168
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:08,927
The commercial becomes
a kind of haiku to the eye,
