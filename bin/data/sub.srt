1
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,744
The first image he told me about was of
three children on a road in Iceland, in 1965.

2
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:35,603
He said that for him
it was the image of happiness...

3
00:00:36,124 --> 00:00:39,210
and also that he had tried several times
to link it to other images...

4
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:40,575
but it never worked.

5
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:41,456
He wrote me...

6
00:00:42,426 --> 00:00:44,825
one day I'll have to put it all alone
at the beginning of a film...

7
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:46,649
with a long piece of black leader.

8
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:52,270
If they don't see happiness in the picture,
at least they'll see the black.

9
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,622
He wrote: "I'm just back from Hokkaido,
the Northern Island.

10
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:30,400
Rich and hurried Japanese take the plane,
others take the ferry:

11
00:01:31,538 --> 00:01:33,873
waiting, immobility,
snatches of sleep.

12
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:38,560
Curiously all of that makes me think
of a past or future war:

13
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:41,150
night trains, air raids,
fallout shelters.

14
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:44,938
Small fragments of war
enshrined in everyday life.

15
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:01,623
He liked the fragility of those moments
suspended in time.

16
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:06,191
Those memories whose only function it being
to leave behind nothing but memories.

17
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,832
He wrote...

18
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:13,125
"I've been round the world several times
and now only banality still interests me".

19
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:17,940
On this trip I've tracked it
with the relentlessness of a bounty hunter.

20
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,828
At dawn we'll be in Tokyo.

21
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:46,203
He used to write me from Africa.

22
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:51,641
He contrasted African time to European time,
and also to Asian time.

23
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,852
He said that in the 19th century
mankind had come to terms with space,

24
00:02:56,185 --> 00:03:01,242
and that the great question of the 20th was
the coexistence of different concepts of time.

25
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:05,689
By the way, did you know that there are emus
in the Île de France?

26
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,549
He wrote me that in the Bijagós Islands
it's the young girls who choose their fiancées.

27
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:23,946
He wrote me that in the suburbs of Tokyo
there is a temple consecrated to cats.

28
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,997
I wish I could convey to you the simplicity,
the lack of affectation...

29
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:50,947
of this couple who had come to place
an inscribed wooden slat in the cat cemetery,

30
00:03:51,646 --> 00:03:54,150
so their cat Tora would be protected.

31
00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:57,686
No she wasn't dead, only run away.

32
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:01,681
But on the day of her death no one
would know how to pray for her,

33
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,607
how to intercede with death so that
he would call her by her right name.

34
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:09,619
So they had to come there,
both of them, under the rain,

35
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:13,635
to perform the rite that would repair
the web of time where it had been broken.

36
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:27,574
He wrote me...

37
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:31,510
"I will have spent my life trying to
understand the function of remembering,

38
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:35,388
"which is not the opposite of forgetting,
but rather its lining.

39
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:41,148
"We do not remember, we rewrite memory
much as history is rewritten.

40
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,130
How can one remember thirst?

41
00:04:56,318 --> 00:04:57,800
He didn't like to dwell on poverty,

42
00:04:58,294 --> 00:05:03,254
but in everything he wanted to show
there were also the 4-Fs of the Japanese model.

43
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,496
A world full of bums, of lumpens,
of outcasts, of Koreans.

44
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:13,240
Too broke to afford drugs,
they'd get drunk on beer, on fermented milk.

45
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,215
This morning in Namidabashi, twenty minutes
from the glories of the center city,

46
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:22,709
a character took his revenge on society
by directing traffic at the crossroads.

47
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,528
Luxury for them would be
one of those large bottles of sake...

48
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:29,910
that are poured over tombs
on the day of the dead.

49
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:58,973
I paid for a round in a bar
in Namidabashi.

50
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:03,484
It's the kind of place that allows people
to stare at each other with equality.

51
00:06:04,355 --> 00:06:08,987
The threshold below which every man is
as good as any other.. and knows it.

52
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:22,986
He told me about the Jetty on Fogo,
in the Cape Verde islands.

53
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:25,986
How long have they been there
waiting for the boat...

54
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,269
patient as pebbles,
but ready to jump?

55
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:34,298
They are a people of wanderers,
of navigators, of world travelers.

56
00:06:34,984 --> 00:06:37,484
They fashioned themselves through
cross-breeding here on these rocks...

57
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:40,976
that the Portuguese used
as a marshaling yard for their colonies.

58
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:47,287
A people of nothing, a people of emptiness,
a vertical people.

59
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:51,916
Frankly, have you ever heard
of anything stupider...

60
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,510
than to say to people as they teach
in film schools, not to look at the camera?

61
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,934
He used to write to me: the Sahel is not only
what is shown of it when it is too late.

62
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:15,280
It's a land that drought seeps
into like water into a leaking boat.

63
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:20,738
The animals resurrected for the time of
a carnival in Bissau will be petrified again,

64
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:24,291
as soon as a new attack
has changed the savannah into a desert.

65
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:28,172
This is a state of survival that
the rich countries have forgotten.

66
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,890
With one exception...
UN Japan.

67
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,515
My constant comings and goings
are not a search for contrasts.

68
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:39,486
They are a journey
to the two extreme poles of survival.

69
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:02,387
He spoke to me of Sei Shonagon,

70
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,620
a lady in waiting to Princess Sadako
at the beginning of the 11th century...

71
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:07,572
in the Heian period.

72
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,780
Do we ever know where history is really made?

73
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,244
Rulers ruled and used complicated strategies
to fight one another.

74
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:19,778
Real power was in the hands
of a family of hereditary regents.

75
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,290
The emperor's court had become
nothing more...

76
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,617
than a place of intrigues
and intellectual games.

77
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,900
By learning to draw a sort
of melancholy comfort...

78
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:29,631
from the contemplation
of the tiniest things...

79
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:33,301
this small group of idlers left a mark
on Japanese sensibility...

80
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:36,874
much deeper than the mediocre thundering
of the politicians.

81
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:40,304
Shonagon had a passion for lists...

82
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:45,168
the list of 'elegant things'...
'distressing things...

83
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:48,766
or even of 'things not worth doing'.

84
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:52,140
One day she got the idea of drawing up a list
of...

85
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:54,352
'things that quicken the heart'.

86
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:58,179
Not a bad criterion I realize
when I'm filming.

87
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,701
I bow to the economic miracle...

88
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:04,257
but what I want to show you
are the neighborhood celebrations.

89
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:33,324
He wrote me...

90
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,230
"Coming back through the Chiba coast
I thought of Shonagon's list,

91
00:13:37,703 --> 00:13:42,956
of all those signs one has only to name
to quicken the heart, just name.

92
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:47,450
To us, a sun is not quite a sun
unless it's radiant...

93
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:50,288
and a spring not quite a spring
unless it is limpid.

94
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,545
Here to place adjectives would be so rude
as leaving price tags on purchases.

95
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:57,424
Japanese poetry never modifies.

96
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,284
There is a way of saying...

97
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:04,718
boat, rock, mist, frog, crow, hail, heron,
chrysanthemum...

98
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,672
that includes them all.

99
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,754
Newspapers have been filled recently
with the story of a man from Nagoya.

100
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:14,721
The woman he loved died last year
and he drowned himself in work...

101
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:16,692
Japanese style, like a madman.

102
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,467
It seems he even made
an important discovery in electronics.

103
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,585
And then in the month of May he killed himself.

104
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:26,310
They say he could not stand
hearing the word 'spring'.

105
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:02,713
He described me his reunion with Tokyo:

106
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:05,431
like a cat who has come home
from vacation in his basket...

107
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,280
immediately starts
to inspect familiar places.

108
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:11,250
He ran off to see if everything
was where it should be:

109
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:13,894
the Ginza owl, the Shimbashi locomotive...

110
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:17,576
the temple of the fox at the top
of the Mitsukoshi department store...

111
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,620
which he found invaded
by little girls and rock singers.

112
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,704
He was told that it was now little girls
who made and unmade stars...

113
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:26,154
the producers shuddered before them.

114
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,196
He was told that a disfigured woman
took off her mask in front of passers-by...

115
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:32,565
and scratched them
if they did not find her beautiful.

116
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,515
Everything interested him.

117
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:37,877
He who didn't give a damn,
if the Dodgers won the pennant...

118
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:39,827
or about the results
of the Daily Double...

119
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:43,755
asked feverishly how Chiyonofuji had done
in the last sumo tournament.

120
00:15:44,472 --> 00:15:47,665
He asked for news of the imperial family,
of the crown prince,...

121
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,680
of the oldest mobster in Tokyo...

122
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,247
who appears regularly on television
to teach goodness to children.

123
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,899
These simple joys he had never felt...

124
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,365
of returning to a country,
a house, a family home.

125
00:15:59,996 --> 00:16:03,402
But twelve million anonymous inhabitants
could supply him with them.

126
00:17:07,495 --> 00:17:08,254
He wrote...

127
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:12,509
"Tokyo is a city crisscrossed by trains,
tied together with electric wire...

128
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,284
she shows her veins.

129
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:17,804
They say that television
makes her people illiterate.

130
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,352
As for me, I've never seen
so many people reading in the streets.

131
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:23,843
Perhaps they read only in the street...

132
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,694
or perhaps they just pretend to read,
these yellow men.

133
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,238
I make my appointments at Kinokuniya,
the big bookshop in Shinjuku.

134
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:34,967
The graphic genius that allowed
the Japanese to invent CinemaScope...

135
00:17:35,162 --> 00:17:36,609
ten centuries before the movies...

136
00:17:36,962 --> 00:17:40,580
compensates a little for the sad fate
of the comic strip heroines,

137
00:17:40,677 --> 00:17:45,287
victims of heartless story writers
and of castrating censorship.

138
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,922
Sometimes they escape,
and you find them again on the walls.

139
00:17:50,691 --> 00:17:52,732
The entire city is a comic strip.

140
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,593
It's Planet Manga.

141
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,485
How can one fail
to recognize the statuary...

142
00:17:57,641 --> 00:18:00,367
that goes from plasticized baroque
to Stalin central?

143
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,130
And the giant faces with eyes that weigh down
on the comic book readers,

144
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:08,318
pictures bigger than people,
voyeurizing the voyeurs.

145
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:21,368
At nightfall the megalopolis
breaks down into villages,

146
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,332
with its country cemeteries
in the shadow of banks...

147
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:26,515
with its stations and temples.

148
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:30,577
Each district of Tokyo once again becomes
a tidy ingenuous little town...

149
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:32,651
nestling amongst the skyscrapers.

150
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:46,290
The small bar in Shinjuku reminded him
of that Indian flute...

151
00:18:46,222 --> 00:18:48,917
whose sound can only be heard
by whomever is playing it.

152
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:54,300
He might have cried out if it was
in a Godard film or a Shakespeare play...

153
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,846
"Where should this music be?"

154
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:03,455
Later he told me he had eaten
at the restaurant in Nishi-nippori...

155
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:07,507
where Mr. Yamada practices
the difficult art of 'action cooking'.

156
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,872
He said that by watching carefully
Mr. Yamada's gestures...

157
00:19:14,137 --> 00:19:15,833
and his way of mixing
the ingredients...

158
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,142
one could meditate usefully
on certain fundamental concepts...

159
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:22,172
common to painting,
philosophy, and karate.

160
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,899
He claimed that Mr. Yamada possessed
in his humble way the essence of style,

161
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:29,147
and consequently that was up to him...

162
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:33,633
to use his invisible brush to write upon
this first day in Tokyo the words...

163
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:37,615
'the end'.

164
00:19:41,826 --> 00:19:45,161
I've spent the day in front of my TV set,
that memory box.

165
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:48,346
I was in Nara with the sacred deers.

166
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:53,475
I was taking a picture without knowing
that in the 15th century Basho had written:

167
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:57,849
"The willow sees the heron's image...
upside down".

168
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:08,927
The commercial becomes
a kind of haiku to the eye,

169
00:20:09,102 --> 00:20:11,179
used to Western atrocities
in this field.

170
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,664
Not understanding obviously
adds to the pleasure.

171
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:19,194
For one slightly hallucinatory moment
I had the impression that I spoke Japanese,

172
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:23,442
but it was a cultural program on NHK
about Gérard de Nerval.

173
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,661
8:40, Cambodia.

174
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,622
From Jean Jacques Rousseau
to the Khmer Rouge...

175
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,815
coincidence,
or the sense of history?

176
00:20:58,311 --> 00:21:03,610
In Apocalypse Now, Brando said a few definitive
and incommunicable sentences:

177
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:06,545
"Horror has a face and a name"...

178
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:11,846
"You must make a friend of horror"...

179
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:16,416
To cast out the horror
that has a name and a face...

180
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,816
you must give it another name
and another face.

181
00:21:20,664 --> 00:21:23,891
Japanese horror movies have the cunning beauty
of certain corpses.

182
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:27,103
Sometimes one is stunned
by so much cruelty.

183
00:21:27,478 --> 00:21:30,959
One seeks its sources in the Asian peoples
long familiarity with suffering...

184
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,736
that requires that even pain
be ornate.

185
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:35,513
And then comes the reward...

186
00:21:36,114 --> 00:21:39,763
the monsters are laid out,
Natsume Masako arises.

187
00:21:40,831 --> 00:21:43,917
Absolute beauty
also has a name and a face.

188
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,662
But the more you watch Japanese television,
the more you feel it's watching you.

189
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:47,153
Even television newscast bears
witness to the fact...

190
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:50,279
that the magical function of the eye
is at the center of all things.

191
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:52,349
It's election time.

192
00:22:52,616 --> 00:22:55,370
The winning candidates black out
the empty eye of Daruma...

193
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:58,103
the spirit of luck,
while losing candidates...

194
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,483
sad but dignified,
carry off their one-eyed Daruma.

195
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,740
The images most difficult to figure out
are those of Europe.

196
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,148
I watched the pictures of a film
whose soundtrack will be added later.

197
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:11,164
It took me six months for Poland.

198
00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:21,500
Meanwhile, I have no difficulty
with local earthquakes.

199
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:25,830
But I must say that last night's quake
helped me greatly to grasp a problem.

200
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,651
Poetry is born of insecurity:
wandering Jews, quaking Japanese;

201
00:23:31,646 --> 00:23:35,482
by living on a rug that jesting nature
is ever ready to pull out from under them...

202
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:38,333
they've got into the habit of moving
about in a world of appearances...

203
00:23:38,952 --> 00:23:40,765
fragile, fleeting, revocable,

204
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:46,319
of trains that fly from planet to planet,
of samurai fighting in an immutable past.

205
00:23:47,471 --> 00:23:49,834
That's called
'the impermanence of things'.

206
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,992
I did it all.

207
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:20,165
All the way to the evening shows for adults,
so called.

208
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,859
The same hypocrisy as in the comic strips,
but it's a coded hypocrisy.

209
00:24:25,535 --> 00:24:29,668
Censorship is not the mutilation of the show,
it is the show.

210
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,386
The code is the message.

211
00:24:31,658 --> 00:24:33,901
It points to the absolute by hiding it.

212
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:36,750
That's what religions have always done.

213
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:50,570
That year...

214
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:55,199
a new face appeared among the great ones
that blazon the streets of Tokyo: the Pope's.

215
00:24:55,957 --> 00:24:57,578
Treasures that had never left
the Vatican...

216
00:24:57,781 --> 00:25:00,542
were shown on the seventh floor
of the Sogo department store.

217
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,189
He wrote me:

218
00:25:03,546 --> 00:25:07,740
"Curiosity of course, and the glimmer
of industrial espionage in the eye.

219
00:25:08,787 --> 00:25:10,764
"I imagine them bringing out
within two years time...

220
00:25:10,938 --> 00:25:14,319
a more efficient
and less expensive version of Catholicism.

221
00:25:15,292 --> 00:25:17,880
But there's also the fascination
associated with the sacred...

222
00:25:18,432 --> 00:25:20,453
even when it's someone else's.

223
00:25:57,291 --> 00:26:01,603
So when will the third floor of Macy's harbor
an exhibition of Japanese sacred signs...

224
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:05,339
such as can be seen at Josen-kai
on the island of Hokkaido?

225
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:10,650
At first one smiles at this place
which combines a museum...

226
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:12,193
a chapel, and a sex shop.

227
00:26:12,511 --> 00:26:16,984
As always in Japan, one admires the fact that
the walls between the realms are so thin...

228
00:26:17,234 --> 00:26:21,506
that one can in the same breath contemplate
a statue, buy an inflatable doll...

229
00:26:21,805 --> 00:26:24,420
and give the goddess of fertility
the small offering...

230
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:26,431
that always accompanies her displays.

231
00:26:28,437 --> 00:26:32,212
Displays whose frankness would make the
stratagems of the television incomprehensible,

232
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:35,726
if it did not at the same time say
that a sex is visible...

233
00:26:35,758 --> 00:26:38,362
only on condition
of being severed from a body.

234
00:26:39,868 --> 00:26:42,439
One would like to believe in a world
before the fall.

235
00:26:43,281 --> 00:26:45,447
Inaccessible to the complications
of a Puritanism...

236
00:26:45,627 --> 00:26:48,851
whose phony shadow has been imposed on it
by American occupation.

237
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,561
Where people who gather
laughing around the votive fountain,

238
00:26:52,773 --> 00:26:55,840
the woman who touches it
with a friendly gesture...

239
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:57,720
share in the same cosmic innocence.

240
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:00,600
The second part of the museum...

241
00:27:00,315 --> 00:27:02,680
with its couples of stuffed animals...

242
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:05,434
would then be the earthly paradise
as we have always dreamed it.

243
00:27:06,990 --> 00:54:13,777
Not so sure...

244
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:10,970
Animal innocence may be a trick
for getting around censorship.

245
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:13,844
But perhaps also the mirror
of an impossible reconciliation.

246
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:19,238
And even without original sin
this earthly paradise may be a paradise lost.

247
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,895
In the glossy splendour
of the gentle animals of Josen-kai...

248
00:27:23,687 --> 00:27:26,330
I read the fundamental rift
of Japanese society...

249
00:27:26,623 --> 00:27:28,921
the rift that separates men from women.

250
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,799
In life it seems to show itself
in two ways only...

251
00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:37,981
violent slaughter, or a discreet melancholy
resembling Sei Shonagon's

252
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:42,658
which the Japanese express
in a single untranslatable word.

253
00:27:43,282 --> 00:27:46,170
So this bringing down of man
to the level of the beasts...

254
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:48,395
against which the fathers
of the church invade...

255
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,671
becomes here the challenge of the beasts
to the poignancy of things,

256
00:27:53,184 --> 00:27:57,535
to a melancholy whose color I can give you
by copying a few lines from Samura Koichi:

257
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,472
"Who said that time heals all wounds?

258
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:04,763
"It would be better to say that time
heals everything except wounds.

259
00:28:05,447 --> 00:28:09,135
"With time, the hurt of separation
loses its real limits.

260
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:12,954
"With time, the desired body
will soon disappear,

261
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:16,951
"and if the desiring body has already ceased
to exist for the other,

262
00:28:17,975 --> 00:28:21,760
"then what remains is a wound...
disembodied."

263
00:28:29,318 --> 00:28:31,191
He wrote me
that the Japanese secret...

264
00:28:31,192 --> 00:28:33,727
what Lévi-Strauss had called
'the poignancy of things'...

265
00:28:34,252 --> 00:28:36,438
implied the faculty of communion
with things...

266
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:38,953
of entering into them,
of being them for a moment.

267
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,636
It was normal that in their turn
they should be like us...

268
00:28:42,797 --> 00:28:44,205
perishable and immortal.

269
00:28:47,648 --> 00:28:48,352
He wrote me:

270
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,400
"Animism is a familiar notion in Africa,
it is less often applied in Japan.

271
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,177
What then shall we call
this diffuse belief...

272
00:28:57,298 --> 00:29:00,884
according to which every fragment
of creation has its invisible counterpart?

273
00:29:02,127 --> 00:29:04,254
When they build a factory
or a skyscraper...

274
00:29:04,415 --> 00:29:07,568
they begin with a ceremony
to appease the god who owns the land.

275
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:13,245
There is a ceremony for brushes, for abacuses,
and even for rusty needles.

276
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:18,853
There's one on the 25th of September
for the repose of the soul of broken dolls.

277
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,571
The dolls are piled up in the temple
of Kiyomitsu consecrated to Kannon...

278
00:29:22,852 --> 00:29:25,942
the goddess of compassion...
and are burned in public.

279
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,469
I look to the participants.

280
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,287
I think the people who saw off
the kamikaze pilots...

281
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:04,935
had the same look on their faces.

282
00:30:37,286 --> 00:30:39,620
He wrote me that the pictures
of Guinea-Bissau...

283
00:30:39,183 --> 00:30:42,640
ought to be accompanied by music
from the Cape Verde islands.

284
00:30:42,963 --> 00:30:47,212
That would be our contribution to the unity
dreamed of by Amilcar Cabral.

285
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:52,540
Why should so small a countryand one so poor
interest the world?

286
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:55,679
They did what they could,
they freed themselves.

287
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,955
They chased out the Portuguese.

288
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:59,864
They traumatized the Portuguese army
to such an extent...

289
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:02,481
that it gave rise to a movement
that overthrew the dictatorship,

290
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:06,211
and led one for a moment to believe
in a new revolution in Europe.

291
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:08,728
Who remembers all that?

292
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,629
History throws its empty bottles
out the window.

293
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,989
This morning I was on the dock at Pidjiguity,

294
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:18,751
where everything began in 1959...

295
00:31:18,872 --> 00:31:21,395
when the first victims of the struggle
were killed.

296
00:31:22,264 --> 00:31:25,271
It may be as difficult to recognize Africa
in this leaden fog...

297
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:30,386
as it is to recognize struggle in the rather
dull activity of tropical longshoremen.

298
00:31:32,354 --> 00:31:34,349
Rumor has it that
every third world leader...

299
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,641
coined the same phrase
the morning after independence:

300
00:31:37,308 --> 00:31:39,506
"Now the real problems start".

301
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:43,883
Cabral never got a chance to say it.
He was assassinated first.

302
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,473
But the problems started, and went on,
and are still going on.

303
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,270
Rather unexciting problems
for revolutionary romanticism:

304
00:31:52,808 --> 00:31:55,151
To work, to produce,
to distribute...

305
00:31:55,577 --> 00:31:59,422
to overcome postwar exhaustion,
temptations of power and privilege.

306
00:32:00,908 --> 00:32:01,533
Ah well...

307
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:06,277
after all, history only tastes bitter to those
who expected it to be sugar coated.

308
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:17,970
My personal problem is more specific:
how to film the ladies of Bissau?

309
00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:21,110
Apparently, the magical function of the eye
was working against me there.

310
00:32:22,175 --> 00:32:24,794
It was in the marketplaces
of Bissau and Cape Verde...

311
00:32:24,844 --> 00:32:27,590
that I could stare at them
again with equality.

312
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,724
I see her.

313
00:32:31,662 --> 00:32:32,878
She saw me.

314
00:32:34,623 --> 00:32:36,144
She knows that I see her.

315
00:32:39,386 --> 00:32:40,714
She drops me her glance...

316
00:32:40,797 --> 00:32:44,642
but just at an angle where it is still possible
to act as though it was not addressed to me.

317
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:47,586
And at the end the real glance,
straightforward...

318
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,778
that lasted a twenty-fourth of a second,
the length of a film frame.

319
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,782
All women have a built-in grain
of indestructibility.

320
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,888
And men's task has always been to make them
realize it as late as possible.

321
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,351
African men are just as good
at this task as others.

322
00:33:10,454 --> 00:33:14,609
But after a close look at African women,
I wouldn't necessarily bet on the men.

323
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,193
He told me the story of the dog Hachiko.

324
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,469
A dog waited every day
for his master at the station.

325
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:08,744
The master died,
and the dog didn't know it...

326
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,200
and he continued to wait all his life.

327
00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:13,746
People were moved
and brought him food.

328
00:35:14,714 --> 00:35:17,251
After his death a statue
was erected in his honor...

329
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:20,105
in front of which sushi and rice cakes
are still placed

330
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:23,362
so that the faithful soul of Hachiko
will never go hungry.

331
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,846
Tokyo is full of these tiny legends,
and of mediating animals.

332
00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:34,954
The Mitsukoshi lion stands guard
on the frontiers...

333
00:35:35,117 --> 00:35:37,408
of what was once the empire
of Mr. Okada...

334
00:35:37,575 --> 00:35:39,307
a great collector of French paintings,

335
00:35:40,174 --> 00:35:42,300
the man who hired
the Château of Versailles...

336
00:35:42,136 --> 00:35:45,409
to celebrate the hundredth anniversary
of his department stores.

337
00:35:46,931 --> 00:35:50,769
In the computer section I've seen young
Japanese exercising their brain muscles...

338
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,720
like the young Athenians at the Palaistra.

339
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:54,691
They have a war to win.

340
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,786
The history books of the future will perhaps
place the battle of integrated circuits...

341
00:35:58,787 --> 00:36:00,962
at the same level
as Salamis and Agincourt,

342
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:06,191
but willing to honor the unfortunate adversary
by leaving other fields to him.

343
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:10,972
Men's fashions this season are placed
under the sign of John Kennedy.

344
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,612
Like an old votive turtle
stationed in the corner of a field...

345
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,596
every day he saw Mr. Akao...

346
00:36:50,915 --> 00:36:53,194
the president
of the Japanese Patriotic Party...

347
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,939
trumpeting from the heights
of his rolling balcony...

348
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,200
against the international communist plot.

349
00:37:01,996 --> 00:37:02,657
He wrote me:

350
00:37:02,962 --> 00:37:06,140
"The automobiles of the extreme right
with their flags and megaphones...

351
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:07,702
are part of Tokyo's landscape.

352
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,400
Mr. Akao is their focal point.

353
00:37:11,601 --> 00:37:14,215
I think he'll have his statue
like the dog Hachiko,

354
00:37:14,448 --> 00:37:18,337
at this crossroads from which he departs
only to go and prophesy on the battlefields.

355
00:37:21,585 --> 00:37:23,116
He was at Narita in the sixties.

356
00:37:24,394 --> 00:37:27,130
Peasants fighting against the building
of an airport on their land,

357
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:31,950
and Mr. Akao denouncing the hand of Moscow
behind everything that moved.

358
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,386
Yurakucho is the political space of Tokyo.

359
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:40,285
Once upon a time I saw bonzes
pray for peace in Vietnam there.

360
00:37:40,756 --> 00:37:42,652
Today young right-wing activists...

361
00:37:42,773 --> 00:37:45,576
protest against the annexation
of the Northern Islands by the Russians.

362
00:37:46,424 --> 00:37:48,795
Sometimes they are answered
that the commercial relations of Japan...

363
00:37:48,989 --> 00:37:50,743
with the abominable occupier
of the North...

364
00:37:50,974 --> 00:37:52,538
are a thousand times better...

365
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:56,479
than with the American ally who is always
whining about economic aggression.

366
00:37:57,381 --> 00:37:59,207
Ah, nothing is simple.

367
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,304
On the other sidewalk,
the Left has the floor.

368
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,199
The Korean Catholic opposition leader,
Kim Dae Jung...

369
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:16,517
kidnapped in Tokyo in '73
by the South Korean gestapo...

370
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,763
is threatened with the death sentence.

371
00:38:19,905 --> 00:38:21,417
A group has begun a hunger strike.

372
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,145
Some very young militants are trying
to gather signatures in his support.

373
00:39:05,524 --> 00:39:08,470
I went back to Narita for the birthday
of one of the victims of the struggle.

374
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,416
The demo was unreal.

375
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,808
I had the impression of acting in Brigadoon,

376
00:39:13,238 --> 00:39:16,158
of waking up ten years later
in the midst of the same players...

377
00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:17,900
with the same blue lobsters of police,

378
00:39:18,164 --> 00:39:22,143
the same helmeted adolescents,
the same banners and the same slogan:

379
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:23,814
"Down with the airport".

380
00:39:24,514 --> 00:39:28,261
Only one thing has been added:
the airport precisely.

381
00:39:28,896 --> 00:39:31,542
But with its single runway
and the barbed wire that chokes it...

382
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:33,371
it looks more besieged
than victorious.

383
00:39:48,414 --> 00:39:50,951
My pal Hayao Yamaneko has found a solution:

384
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,255
if the images of the present don't change,
then change the images of the past.

385
00:39:58,444 --> 00:40:01,561
He showed me the clashes of the sixties
treated by his synthesizer:

386
00:40:02,238 --> 00:40:05,568
pictures that are less deceptive he says
with the conviction of a fanatic...

387
00:40:05,689 --> 00:40:07,316
than those you see on television.

388
00:40:07,566 --> 00:40:10,360
At least they proclaim themselves
to be what they are:

389
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:10,892
images...

390
00:40:11,153 --> 00:40:15,189
not the portable and compact form
of an already inaccessible reality.

391
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,391
Hayao calls his machine's world the 'zone',
an homage to Tarkovsky.

392
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,692
What Narita brought back to me,
like a shattered hologram,

393
00:41:12,966 --> 00:41:15,545
was an intact fragment
of the generation of the sixties.

394
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,171
If to love without illusions is still to love,
I can say that I loved it.

395
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:23,161
It was a generation that often exasperated me,

396
00:41:23,466 --> 00:41:26,210
for I didn't share its utopia of uniting
in a common struggle...

397
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:30,195
those who revolt against poverty
and those who revolt against wealth.

398
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:34,951
But it screamed out that gut reaction that
better adjusted voices no longer knew how...

399
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:36,805
or no longer dared to utter.

400
00:41:41,317 --> 00:41:44,240
I met peasants there who had come
to know themselves through the struggle.

401
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,864
Concretely it had failed.

402
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,295
At the same time, all they had won
in their understanding of the world...

403
00:41:50,687 --> 00:41:52,584
could have been won
only through the struggle.

404
00:41:55,301 --> 00:41:56,443
As for the students...

405
00:41:56,493 --> 00:41:59,833
some massacred each other in the mountains
in the name of revolutionary purity,

406
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:03,404
while others had studied capitalism
so thoroughly to fight it...

407
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,274
that they now provide it
with its best executives.

408
00:42:06,835 --> 00:42:10,114
Like everywhere else the movement
had its postures and its careerists...

409
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:13,823
including, and there are some,
those who made a career of martyrdom.

410
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,758
But it carried with it all those who said,
like Ché Guevara, that...

411
00:42:17,891 --> 00:42:22,330
they "trembled with indignation every time
an injustice is committed in the world".

412
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,717
They wanted to give a political meaning
to their generosity...

413
00:42:26,221 --> 00:42:28,518
and their generosity
has outlasted their politics.

414
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:32,890
That's why I will never allow it to be said
that youth is wasted on the young.

415
00:42:48,964 --> 00:42:51,467
The youth who get together
every weekend at Shinjuku...

416
00:42:51,548 --> 00:42:54,499
obviously know that they are not
on a launching pad toward real life;

417
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:58,610
but they are life, to be eaten
on the spot like fresh doughnuts.

418
00:42:59,111 --> 00:43:00,623
It's a very simple secret.

419
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,310
The old try to hide it,
and not all the young know it.

420
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,468
The ten-year-old girl who threw her friend...

421
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:09,195
from the thirteenth floor of a building
after having tied her hands,

422
00:43:10,452 --> 00:43:13,187
because she'd spoken badly of their
class team, hadn't discovered it yet.

423
00:43:13,982 --> 00:43:16,856
Parents who demand an increase
in the number of special telephone lines...

424
00:43:16,977 --> 00:43:18,908
devoted to the prevention
of children's suicides...

425
00:43:19,237 --> 00:43:22,206
find out a little late
that they have kept it all too well.

426
00:43:22,722 --> 00:43:25,774
Rock is an international language
for spreading the secret.

427
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:29,464
Another is peculiar to Tokyo.

428
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:37,220
For the takenoko,
twenty is the age of retirement.

429
00:43:38,294 --> 00:43:39,705
They are baby Martians.

430
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,903
I go to see them dance
every Sunday in the park at Yoyogi.

431
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:47,143
They want people to look at them,
but they don't seem to notice that people do.

432
00:43:47,745 --> 00:43:49,643
They live in a parallel time sphere...

433
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:53,803
a kind of invisible aquarium wall
separates them from the crowd they attract,

434
00:43:54,151 --> 00:43:58,485
and I can spend a whole afternoon contemplating
the little takenoko girl who is learning

435
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:01,683
no doubt for the first time,
the customs of her planet.

436
00:44:15,273 --> 00:44:19,480
Beyond that, they wear dog tags,
they obey a whistle, the Mafia rackets them,

437
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:22,371
and with the exception
of a single group made up of girls...

438
00:44:22,532 --> 00:44:24,372
it's always a boy who commands.

439
00:45:18,414 --> 00:45:21,764
One day he writes to me:
description of a dream.

440
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,958
More and more my dreams find their settings
in the department stores of Tokyo,

441
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:31,559
the subterranean tunnels that extend them
and run parallel to the city.

442
00:45:32,149 --> 00:45:34,917
A face appears, disappears...
a trace is found, is lost.

443
00:45:35,773 --> 00:45:37,774
All the folklore of dreams
is so much in its place...

444
00:45:37,895 --> 00:45:39,100
that the next day
when I am awake...

445
00:45:39,776 --> 00:45:42,144
I realize that I continue to seek
in the basement labyrinth...

446
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,429
the presence
concealed the night before.

447
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:49,800
I begin to wonder if those dreams
are really mine...

448
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:50,827
or if they are part of a totality...

449
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:55,296
of a gigantic collective dream of which
the entire city may be the projection.

450
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:58,509
It might suffice to pick up
any one of the telephones...

451
00:45:58,647 --> 00:46:02,695
that are lying around to hear
a familiar voice, or the beating of a heart,

452
00:46:02,978 --> 00:46:04,586
Sei Shonagon's for example.

453
00:46:05,336 --> 00:46:06,907
All the galleries lead to stations...

454
00:46:07,396 --> 00:46:10,850
the same companies own the stores
and the railroads that bear their name.

455
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,467
Keio, Odakyu...
all those names of ports.

456
00:46:14,999 --> 00:46:19,177
The train inhabited by sleeping people
puts together all the fragments of dreams...

457
00:46:19,288 --> 00:46:22,380
makes a single film of them,
the ultimate film.

458
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,367
The tickets from the automatic dispenser
grant admission to the show.
